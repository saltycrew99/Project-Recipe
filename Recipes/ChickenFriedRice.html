        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, you'll want to get your brown rice going in a small sauce pan. Pour 2 cups of water to 1 cup of rice and cook. Once rice looks soaked enough, let sit for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then heat up a frying pan to about 60% heat. While heating up, add a pinch of salt, pepper, and garlic to each side of chicken thighs.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken into the pan and cook each side for about 5-6 minutes or until a good crust forms on each side.</li>
            <li>Take the chicken out and cut into smaller pieces. Throw the chicken back in the pan with the brown rice.</li>   
            <li>Add peas and carrots mix with a few dashes of soy sauce to coat the rice into a darker shade.</li>
            <li>Once everything has cooked together, add butter and stir. Once butter is mostly melted, add the egg and scramble.</li>
            <li>Viola, enjoy the mouth watering recipe of Chicken Fried Rice from Ghandi himself (not really).</li>
