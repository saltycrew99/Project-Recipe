        <!-- Step by Step process for Steak Alfredo -->
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First you'll want to get a good size pot filled with water, set it to a boil, and add the noodles. Once noodles are added, sprinkle about a tablespoon of italian seasoning.</li>
            <li>Now heat up your pan to about 65%. Add the butter and once it's melted add the steak of choice. For better flavor and crust season the steak before putting it on the pan with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Strain noodles once they've cooked for about 7-8 minutes. While it strains, take steak out after 5-6 minutes on each side and cut it fajita style.</li>
            <li>Place steak and noodles together in pan and add the alfredo sauce. Once mixed together, add about 1/2 tablespoon of paprika and the same for italian seasoning.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some of the parmesan on top and enjoy your GD masterpiece my guy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you taste this you're going to want to jump off a 59 floor building right into a moving firetruck because you're going to feel like an invincible God. You're welcome.</p>
